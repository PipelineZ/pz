# Changelog

Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions are git
tags (`v*`), computed into package versions by MinVer. Breaking changes are listed
first in each release, each with a migration note — see
the [versioning policy](https://pipelinez.dev/versioning/).

## [Unreleased]

Everything below ships in the first public release.

### The tool

- `pz` as a self-contained .NET global tool: `init`, `compile`, `plan`, `validate
  [--connect]`, `restore`, `run`, `test`, `retry`, `ls`, `connectors`, `cdc`,
  `clean`, `state`, `schema`, `mcp`. Exit codes 0/1/2/3; `--log-format json`
  emits the documented NDJSON event stream (https://pipelinez.dev/events/).
- dbt-shaped authoring: one `connections.yml` (connections → entities), SQL
  pipelines with `ref()`/`source()`/`sink()` templating, checks as first-class
  nodes, a compiled and inspectable DAG under `.pz/target`.
- DuckDB as the engine: sources stage into a per-run DuckDB database, SQL runs
  in-process, sinks drain out over zero-copy Arrow; two data-plane tiers (native
  scan/copy and the universal Arrow path) chosen per node by the planner.
- Incremental EL: SQL-declared watermarks, bounded backfill windows, commit-gated
  advancement, per-instance retries and circuit breakers, `pz retry` with staged
  data reuse and carried-forward sinks, CDC from Postgres (pgoutput) and SQL
  Server (change tables) with `pz cdc status`/`drop`.
- Correctness guardrails: schema-drift detection (`on_source_drift`), duplicate
  merge-key warnings (PZ0522), lossy integer-inference warnings (PZ0523),
  ambiguous date-order warnings (PZ0524), memory budgeting with disclosed limits.
- Eight first-party connectors: local files (csv/NDJSON/parquet), Postgres,
  SQL Server, MySQL, SQLite, S3-compatible object storage (source and sink,
  with a documented Google Cloud Storage recipe via its S3 interoperability
  mode), Azure Blob Storage, HTTP APIs. Object-store format parity: parquet,
  csv, and NDJSON json on local files, S3, and Azure Blob alike, in both
  directions.
  Third-party connectors ship as ordinary NuGet packages against the versioned
  ABI in `Pz.Connectors.Abstractions`, with `Pz.Connectors.TestKit` as the
  acceptance suite.
- `pz mcp`: a Model Context Protocol server exposing typed introspect/verify/
  author tools (execution gated behind `--allow-run`), with credential and
  path-containment guards for agent-driven use.
- State that can leave the machine: SQL Server- and HTTP-backed state stores for
  ephemeral hosts; local deterministic JSON artifacts otherwise.
